The DriverPass project included designed a program that drivers of a company could log into in order to receive training or check their profile or other
requirements set forth by their employer. I think that I planned this project pretty well. I also think that I managed my time very well for this project.
I did not feel rushed when completing my submissions. If I had to revise and edit anything, it would probably be the UML diagrams. Those are still pretty hard for me.
I interpreted user needs by reviewing the client's requirements and based my program around that.
